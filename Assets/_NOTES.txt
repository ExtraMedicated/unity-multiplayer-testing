Fix returning to room scene. Sending message without handler?
	Regardless, it's probably worth scrapping much of the custom ExtNetworkRoomManager stuff and trying the defaults again.

Listen for lobby changes?

Find a better way to refresh the player list and statuses.

	Also remember to do something when the round is over.

Need to be able to find private lobby.

PlayFab lobby invitations?

Chat! Voice and text


Reminder: NetworkClient has public static localPlayer.

-------------------------

ExtNetworkRoomPlayer is the class that represents a connected player.

LobbiesUI.JoinedLobby(Lobby) called when PlayFab API call succeeds.
	Sets PlayerEntity.LocalPlayer.lobbyInfo.
	Gets the server connection info and then networkManager.StartClient() is called.
		This triggers the authentication flow (via NetworkManager.OnClientConnectInternal()).
			Calls NewNetworkAuthenticator.OnClientAuthenticate()
				Invokes LobbiesUI.AuthenticateClient() which sends the AuthRequestMessage.
		LobbiesUI.OnAuthResponse() sets the NetworkClient.connection.authenticationData values.
		NewNetworkAuthenticator.OnAuthResponseMessage():
			calls ServerAccept()
				which invokes NetworkManager.OnServerAuthenticated()
					which sends the SceneMessage to the client.
			calls ClientAccept()
				which invokes NetworkManager.OnClientAuthenticated()
					which calls NetworkRoomManager.OnClientConnect()
						then NetworkRoomManager.OnRoomClientConnect()
						and NetworkManager.OnClientConnect()
							which calls NetworkClient.Ready()
							and NetworkClient.AddPlayer()
								AddPlayer() sends the AddPlayerMessage to the server.

NetworkManager handles the SceneMessage with OnClientSceneInternal()
	which calls ClientChangeScene()

NetworkManager handles the AddPlayerMessage with OnServerAddPlayerInternal()
	which calls ExtNetworkRoomManager.OnServerAddPlayer()
		base.OnServerAddPlayer() calls ExtNetworkRoomManager.OnRoomServerCreateRoomPlayer() to actually instantiate the room player.
		and NetworkServer.AddPlayerForConnection().
	ExtNetworkRoomManager.OnServerAddPlayer() invokes OnPlayerAdded.

NetworkServer.AddPlayerForConnection():
	sets the connection identity
	sets NetworkClient.localPlayer
	calls SetClientReady()
	calls Respawn()

--------------

JoinedLobbyUI.StartGame() sends the BeginGameMessage to the server
	which triggers OnStartGameMessage()
		which calls NetworkRoomManager.ServerChangeScene()
			which calls NetworkServer.ReplacePlayerForConnection() with the roomPlayer
			and ServerChangeScene()
				which sends the SceneMessage to the clients.
